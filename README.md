### Example of react-native-css-interop large cache

With the tailwind config from gluestack-ui-v2 react-native-css-interop generated a cache file that is ~4.3mb minified js. This adds ~250+ms app load time just by being included.

Is this expected or intended behavior with nativewind? Is there a significant runtime performance to this?
